# Person Identification with Facial Recognition using YOLOv8

This repository contains the implementation of a real-time **Person Identification System** using facial recognition, based on the **YOLOv8** object detection model. The system is designed to detect and identify individuals in real-time using facial features, tailored for robust performance in diverse environments.

## Features

-   Real-time face detection and person identification
-   High-speed inference with YOLOv8
-   Accurate and secure identification
-   Pre-processing with facial alignment and augmentation
-   Custom-trained model on annotated facial datasets
-   Comprehensive evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score, and mAP
-   Experimental results and case studies included

## Model Architecture

-   **YOLOv8** for efficient object detection
-   Custom CNN-based facial feature extractor
-   Trained on labeled datasets with person-specific annotations
-   Softmax classification for identity prediction

## Dataset

-   **Source**: Own Custom Dataset
-   Contains images with varied poses, lighting conditions, and occlusions, teared, noisy, and blurry
-   Data split: `Train (70%)`, `Validation (15%)`, `Test (15%)`
-   Pre-processing: Face alignment, resizing, augmentation (flip, rotate, crop)

## Usage

Run real-time identification (webcam):

```bash
python identify.py --source 0 --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt

```

Run on an image:

```bash
python identify.py --source path/to/image.jpg --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt

```

Train a custom model:

```bash
yolo detect train data=data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640

```

## üìä Evaluation

Metrics used for evaluation:

-   [mAP@0.5](mailto:mAP@0.5)
-   Precision, Recall, F1-score
-   Confusion Matrix

Run evaluation:

```bash
python evaluate.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --data data.yaml

```
